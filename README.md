# n8n Workflows for Plex (BETA)

This repository contains useful and creative **n8n workflows** designed to enhance and automate your **Plex Media Server** experience.

I created this repo to share practical tools and ideas that simplify media management using **n8n** â€” a powerful, low-code workflow automation tool thatâ€™s easy to work with, even for users with basic sysadmin knowledge.

## Why n8n?

[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is a versatile, open-source workflow automation platform that allows you to connect and control APIs, services, and scripts without writing full applications. It runs perfectly in Docker and is ideal for automating media workflows for services like:

- Plex
- Radarr, Sonarr (*Arrs)
- Tautulli
- Trakt.TV
- Debrid providers (Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, etc.)

Because of its modular design and visual interface, **n8n makes it easy to test, build, and maintain powerful automations**, even for non-developers.

## Vision for This Project

The goal of this repository is to:

- Share ready-to-use workflows for Plex automation
- Make advanced ideas easier to build, manage, and maintain
- Collaborate with the community to turn rough concepts into polished tools
- Eventually develop standalone Docker-based tools once ideas are fully matured
